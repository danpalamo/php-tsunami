# /IT MUST BE ASSUMED/ that the php-tsunami scripts, particularly
# those exposed via the web are /UNSAFE/ and may be subject to
# various bugs and exploits

# /IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED/ that the web access be restricted
# via htpasswd and/or any other security features to limit
# access to these scripts

# installation tested with ubuntu 16.04-lts
# the following packages must be installed...bits of php-tsunami
# might silently fail if these packages are not installed

# snmp
# rrdtool
# apache2
# libapache2-mod-php7.0
# php7.0-json
# php7.0-snmp
# php7.0-xml

# default paths
# tsunami home : /usr/local/tsunami/
# tsunami web : /var/www/html/tsunami/
# tsunami rrds : /usr/local/tsunami/rrd/
# tsunami graphs : /var/www/html/tsunami/graphs/
# tsunami logs : /var/log/tsunami/

# copy the contents of php-tsunami/web/ to your web directory
# example:
# cp -r /usr/local/tsunami/web/* /var/www/html/tsunami/

# tsunami assumes a 5-minute interval for polling
# tsunami generally can poll several dozen hosts in this time
# period, provided there are no down hosts
# down hosts significantly increase the time it takes tsunami
# to poll, and if the poll time exceeds 5 minutes, generally
# bad things might happen, such as missing or out-of-order data
# being placed into your rrd files or the web cache

# the grapher can generally be run a few times per day, depending
# on your needs
# it is not recommended to run the grapher too often as it is
# very cpu-intensive and might affect polling data while running

# the viewer can be run very quickly and can be run any time the
# grapher runs

# EXAMPLE crontab entries
#*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/php /usr/local/tsunami/tsunami_collector.php >> /var/log/tsunami/tsunami_collector.log 2>&1
#57 */4 * * * /usr/bin/php /usr/local/tsunami/tsunami_grapher.php >> /var/log/tsunami/tsunami_collector.log 2>&1
#9 */4 * * * /usr/bin/php /usr/local/tsunami/tsunami_viewer.php >> /var/log/tsunami/tsunami_collector.log 2>&1

# log rotation is needed to keep this file from growing
# EXAMPLE tsunami.logrotate
# /var/log/tsunami/*.log {
# rotate 9

#  compress
