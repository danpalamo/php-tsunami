# /IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED/ that the web access be restricted

# installation tested with ubuntu 16.04-lts
# the following packages must be installed...bits of php-tsunami
# might silently fail if these packages are not installed

# snmp
# rrdtool
# apache2
# libapache2-mod-php7.0
# php7.0-json
# php7.0-snmp
# php7.0-xml

# default paths
# tsunami home : /usr/local/tsunami/
# tsunami web : /var/www/html/tsunami/
# tsunami rrds : /usr/local/tsunami/rrd/
# tsunami graphs : /var/www/html/tsunami/graphs/
# tsunami logs : /var/log/tsunami/

# install php-tsunami with git:
# git clone https://github.com/danpalamo/php-tsunami /usr/local/tsunami

# copy the contents of php-tsunami/web/ to your web directory
# example:
# cp -r /usr/local/tsunami/web/* /var/www/html/tsunami/

# copy and edit config files
# cp /usr/local/tsunami/config/tsunami_config.php.example /usr/local/tsunami/config/tsunami_config.php
# cp /usr/local/tsunami/config/tsunami_hosts.xml.example /usr/local/tsunami/config/tsunami_hosts.xml
# edit these files to reflect your local configuration and equipment

# tsunami assumes a 5-minute interval for polling
# tsunami generally can poll several dozen hosts in this time
# period, provided there are no down hosts
# down hosts significantly increase the time it takes tsunami
# to poll, and if the poll time exceeds 5 minutes, generally
# bad things might happen, such as missing or out-of-order data
# being placed into your rrd files or the web cache

# the grapher can generally be run a few times per day, depending
# on your needs
# it is not recommended to run the grapher too often as it is
# very cpu-intensive and might affect polling data while running

# the viewer can be run very quickly and can be run any time the
# grapher runs

# EXAMPLE crontab entries

# log rotation is needed to keep this file from growing

# UPGRADING
# Older versions of tsunami_collector.php stored counter-like data
# as type COUNTER. Newer versions store this data as DERIVED.
# This helps eliminate unwanted spikes when a counter goes backwards,
# such as when a device reboots and the byte counter on an interface
# is lower than the previous sample.

# Upgrading from prior versions of collector requires manipulation
# of the already-existing .rrd files directly in order to gain this
# benefit. New data sources will be generated with the DERIVE data
# type automatically.

# At the same time, you will need to define the minimum values (0)
# in the DERIVE DS's. The exact DS's will be different on each type
# of equipment, so one must take care to find the right matching
# query to identify the proper DS's.

# Example DS types
# ETH_IN_B
# ETH_OUT_B
# FRAME_AVAIL_DN
# FRAME_AVAIL_UP
# FRAME_USED_DN
# FRAME_USED_UP
# RF_DROP_P
# RF_IN_B
# RF_OUT_B
# RF_IN_KBPS
# RF_OUT_KBPS
# RF_IN_O
# RF_OUT_O
# RF_IN_P
# RF_OUT_P
# SFP1_IN_B
# SFP1_OUT_B
# WLAN1_IN_B
# WLAN1_OUT_B
# WLAN1_SU_COUNT
# WLAN2_IN_B
# WLAN2_OUT_B
# WLAN2_SU_COUNT

# changing data store type:
# rrdtool tune test.rrd --data-source-type some_ds:DERIVE

# setting minimum value to zero for data store
# rrdtool tune test.rrd -i some_ds:0

# you can then dump each .rrd file to an .xml and restore it,
# which should make the now-negative deltas become UNKNOWN or
# zero.

# /usr/local/tsunami/rrd# for EACH in $LIST \
# do rrdtool dump $EACH > $EACH.xml \
# mv $EACH $EACH.bak \
# rrdtool restore $EACH.xml $EACH --range-check \
# done
